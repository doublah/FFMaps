Map History:
I originally made a map called arena_dm for TFC with multiple arenas for training.
This map is basically the same idea but for Fortress Forever.
There's not much to say.
I combined the basic mulch like arenas with r8eD's popular blockfort arena...
so a full server of 20 could be entertained.
The teleport system spawnroom is an unfortunite but acceptable price to pay
for a multi-arena style map.

I wanted some custom textures to add character so I chose
a great artist named Frank Frazetta whom everyone should know.
It made the map file huge and I'm sure everyone will complain but...
I'm not sure I care enough... I know you all have cable connections.
I'm going to culture you addicts damn it!
