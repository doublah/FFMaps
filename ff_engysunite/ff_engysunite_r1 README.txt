Map History:
I wanted to make an engy only map with a simple design.
I made a map for TFC called alliance which was a four team capture the flag style,
where teams had an allied team to aid and an enemy team to attack.
Caps against your enemy gave the most points and if your allied capped you'd get half points.
This borrows from that idea:
I have allied teams but you only get points for capping against your designated enemy team.
Supporting your allies simply ensures that your main entrance stays locked down longer.

The theme of the map borrows from the Greek or Byzantine. I was going for a hanging gardens look.
I know some people maybe discouraged that they have zero cells on spawn, but I felt this was
an important balancing issue. I didn't want the map to be too defensive, and I didn't want death
to become an easy solution for resupplying. When the armory is locked off, there is absolutely no
source for an engineer to retrieve metal unless he has a dispenser... this forces them
to go offensive. Of course a good alliance could coordinate metal use.

So the beta test went well. I updated the loadscreen to an actual map overhead view showing
some important tips. I also tweaked the locations a little and alligned a few textures.
